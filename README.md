## Introduction

Understanding the determinants of housing prices is crucial for stakeholders in the real estate market. This project utilizes regression techniques to model and predict housing prices based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information on various attributes of houses, including:

- **Price**: The sale price of the house.
- **Size**: Square footage of the house.
- **Bedrooms**: Number of bedrooms.
- **Bathrooms**: Number of bathrooms.
- **Location**: Geographic location of the house.
- *(Include other relevant features as applicable.)*

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

To ensure the quality of the analysis, the following steps were undertaken:

- **Handling Missing Values**: Removed entries with missing data.
- **Removing Duplicates**: Eliminated duplicate records.
- **Outlier Detection and Removal**: Applied the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to identify and remove outliers.
- **Feature Encoding**: Converted categorical variables into numerical representations using one-hot encoding.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to uncover patterns and relationships within the data:

- **Pair Plots**: Visualized relationships between features and the target variable.
- **Correlation Matrix**: Identified multicollinearity among features.
- *(Include other EDA techniques as applied.)*

## Modeling

A multiple linear regression model was developed:

- **Train-Test Split**: Divided the data into training and testing sets (80/20 split).
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardized features to have zero mean and unit variance.
- **Model Training**: Utilized Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to fit the model.

## Results

The model's performance was evaluated using:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: *(Report the MSE value.)*
- **R-squared (R²)**: *(Report the R² value.)*

Residual analysis was performed to assess the model's assumptions and fit.

## Conclusion

The regression analysis identified significant predictors of housing prices, including:

- *(List significant features.)*

These insights can inform stakeholders in making data-driven decisions in the housing market.

## Future Work

Potential improvements and extensions of this project include:

- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to enhance model performance.
- **Advanced Modeling**: Exploring non-linear models or machine learning algorithms.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Incorporating geographic information systems (GIS) to analyze spatial dependencies.
